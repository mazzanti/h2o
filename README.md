Yet another Javascript GUI Framework

I know some code looks nightmare, this is an alpha version I built from scratch.
There are lot of lacks but it comes with a small lib of components and an internal form designer.

# server requirements
- php 5
- mysql >= 5.7

# third parties js:
- jquery/ui
- d3
- jsbarcode
- qrcodejs
- codemirror
